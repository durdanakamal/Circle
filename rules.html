                 </h1>
                 
                 <h3>For lenders</h3>
                 <p>
                    1.	For registration, you must provide proof of your ID, address details, and contact info.
                   
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    2.	You must ensure that your products are well-maintained and do not have any damage.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    3.	Ensure that the pictures of the product(s) you upload are clear and accurate of the product
                     to be rented. If not, your product(s) shall be removed from our listing. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    4.	Provide an accurate description of the product(s) to be listed along with the retail price.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    5.	Rent price should not be more than 40 – 50 % of the actual retail price.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    6.	You can confirm the order only after the borrower chooses their preferred payment 
                    method: Cash on Delivery / bkash / card.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    7.	If your product gets damaged by the borrower in any way, they are responsible for its repair, 
                    cleaning and / or replacement costs. Otherwise, seek fair monetary compensation from the borrower.
                     If there is a conflict, seek our help for mediation. Rest assured; we shall ensure
                      you’re compensated for justly.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    8.	If the borrower is late in returning your item and doesn’t pay for it either, 
                    we shall do everything in our power to ensure you are paid fairly. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    9.	If necessary, you can communicate with the borrower too by sending a private message.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    10.	No rude language, bullying, or sexual harassment will be tolerated under any circumstances. 
                    If found guilty, your account will be revoked, and you shall not be part of our community anymore.
                 </p>
